/*
 Input:
    vector<vector<int> > shells_cnt
        List with all CNTs grouped into sub-regions in order to reduce computational cost of finding the CNTs intersected by the boundaries of the observation window
    int window
        Current sub-region that contains the CNTs to be trimmed
    struct Geom_sample sample
        Geometry of the generated sample
    struct Nanotube_Geo cnts
        Geometry of the CNTs
    vector<vector<long int> > structure
        Vector with the structure. Since CNTs might get trimmed, this vector will be modified to delete points and add more CNTs and points.
    vector<double> radii
        List of radii. Using this vector allows for the code to be able to work with CNTs of different radii. As CNTs might be added, the radii of the new CNTs need also to be included in the vector
    vector<Point_3D> points_in
        Vector with the point coordinates. Since points at the boundaries of the observation window are going to be added, this vector needs to be modified
 
 Output (These three are class variables):
    vector<int> cnts_inside
        List with the CNTs that are inside the observation window and that will be used for future computations
    vector<int> cnts_inside
        List with the GNPs that are inside the observation window and that will be used for future computations
    vector<vector<int> > boundary_cnt
        Vectors that contains the CNTs on each of the six boundaries. These are needed to determine percolation
            boundary_cnt[0] corresponds to x0
            boundary_cnt[1] corresponds to x1
            boundary_cnt[2] corresponds to y0
            boundary_cnt[3] corresponds to y1
            boundary_cnt[4] corresponds to z0
            boundary_cnt[5] corresponds to z1
    vector<vector<int> > boundary_cnt
        Vectors that contains the CNTs on each of the six boundaries. These are needed to determine percolation
            boundary_gnp[0] corresponds to x0
            boundary_gnp[1] corresponds to x1
            boundary_gnp[2] corresponds to y0
            boundary_gnp[3] corresponds to y1
            boundary_gnp[4] corresponds to z0
            boundary_gnp[5] corresponds to z1
 
 Modified inputs:
    vector<vector<long int> > structure
    vector<double> radii
    vector<Point_3D> points_in
